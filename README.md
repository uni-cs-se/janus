## Janus
This page will contain information on Janus, a project investigating how incomplete specifications can be used to detect security vulnerabilities at low cost to companies.

As the project progresses, this project will include source code for our experiments and configuration files for our testing environments so that others may run our work on their own and expand upon it.

As this is currently an academic project with continued publication targets, the software contained on this page may not be the most current version.  Please contact Andrew Berns at <andrew.berns@uni.edu> for information on the latest project version.
